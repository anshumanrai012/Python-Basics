Well, either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villan.
Deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be but, its not who you are underneath,
its what you do that defines you.
I seek the means to fight injustice, to turn fear against those who pray on fearful.
Come on, come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe thede people anymore. You have given them everything.
Not Everything, not yet.
